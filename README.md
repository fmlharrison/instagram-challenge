As usual please start by forking this repo. After cloning your fork and cd'ing into it, you'll need to initialize a Rails app in the current directory.

Your challenge is to build Instagram using Rails. You'll need users who can post pictures, write comments on pictures and like a picture. Style it like Instagram's website (or more awesome).

Bonus if you can add filters!
